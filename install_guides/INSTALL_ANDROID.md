# Zonetic Installation Guide (Android - Termux)

Follow these steps to configure the **Zonetic** command-line interface on Android. This process uses **Termux** to create a global environment for the compiler.

## 0. Install Termux (Read Carefully)

Termux is a terminal emulator that provides a Linux environment. **Do not use the Google Play Store version**, as it is outdated.

1.  **Download**: Go to the [Official F-Droid Page](https://f-droid.org/es/packages/com.termux/).
2.  **Select Version**: Scroll down to the "Versions" or "Packages" section. Download the latest version available that **DOES NOT** have the "(beta)" tag in its name.
3.  **Install the APK**:
    *   Once downloaded, tap the file to install.
    *   **Security Prompt**: Android might say it is an "Unsafe App" because it's an APK.
    *   **How to bypass**: Tap on **"More details"** and then select **"Install anyway"**.
4.  **Open**: Launch Termux and wait for the "Installing bootstrap" process to finish.

## 1. Prerequisites

First, update your package list:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Install Python
Zonetic requires Python 3.10 or higher. If you don't have it, install it:
```bash
pkg install python
```
Verify with:
```bash
python --version
```

### Install Git & Binutils
If you cannot clone repositories, install Git:
```bash
pkg install git binutils
```
(Optional) Verify Git:
```bash
git --version
```

## 2. Clone the Repository

Once Git is installed, clone the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alve-dev/zonetic-lang-tree-walker-version.git zonetic
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **WARNING**: Do not modify, move, or delete files inside the `zonetic/` directory after installation. Doing so will break the compiler and the global command.

## 3. Navigate and Set Permissions

Move to the compiler source directory and grant execution permissions to the entry point:

```bash
cd zonetic/src/zonc
chmod +x main.py
```

## 4. Create the System Link

Link the script to the internal binary folder (no sudo required in Termux):

```bash
ln -s $(pwd)/main.py $PREFIX/bin/zon
```

## 5. Verify Installation

Test the installation by checking the version:

```bash
zon vers
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Command not found**
If the terminal does not recognize the command immediately, restart Termux or run:
```bash
hash -r
```

**Broken Link**
The symbolic link depends on the absolute path of the source file. If you move the zonetic folder, you must recreate the link:
```bash
rm $PREFIX/bin/zon
cd new/path/to/zonetic/src/zonc
ln -s $(pwd)/main.py $PREFIX/bin/zon
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the `zon` command from your system:

```bash
rm $PREFIX/bin/zon
```

---

## Quick Start: REPL Mode

Zonetic features a built-in **REPL** (Interactive Mode) that allows you to write and execute code on the fly without creating permanent files. It uses a temporary buffer that clears itself after execution.

### How to use `zon repl`

1. **Enter the REPL**:
   ```bash
   zon repl
   ```
2. **Write your code**: You can write multiple lines.
3. **Execute**: Type `EOF` on a new line or press `Ctrl+D` to trigger execution.

**Example:**
```bash
>> mut counter = 0 
>> while counter <= 5 {
>>    print(counter)
>>    counter += 1
>> }
>> EOF
```

**Result:**
```text
--- Executing ---
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

> [!TIP]
> This mode is perfect for testing logic or syntax quickly. Once the output is displayed, the temporary environment is wiped clean.

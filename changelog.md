## v0.0.9 — *In Progress*
> The Great Refactor Update — language renamed from **Akon** to **Zonetic**

This is the biggest and most important update to date. Nearly everything was rewritten from scratch.

**Language & Identity**
- Language renamed from **Akon** to **Zonetic**
- `zon-cli` replaces `akon-cli`
- Zonny mascot added to the error system

**Lexer**
- Full rewrite with span system
- Binary search index for exact line and column reporting
- `FileMap` for source location tracking

**Normalizer**
- Full rewrite with hybrid statement terminator
- Supports both `;` and newline as statement terminators (one per script)

**Parser**
- Full rewrite with new AST hierarchy — `NodeStmt` and `NodeExpr`
- Real mutability system with `mut` and `inmut`
- Explicit type annotation with `: type` or `UNKNOWN` for future inference
- Form concept introduced — `if form`, `while form`, `infinity form`
- `give` statement for block expressions
- Operator enums — `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `FDIV`, `IDIV`, `MOD`, `POW`, etc.
- Type enums — `INT`, `FLOAT`, `BOOL`, `STRING`, `UNKNOWN`
- Basic scope system with parent chain

**Diagnostic System** *(new)*
- Indexed error codes — `E####` for errors, `W####` for warnings
- Span-aware error reporting with source line, column pointer, and context
- Severity system — `ERROR` and `WARNING`
- Error registry — all errors defined as data, not hardcoded strings
- Error limit system with summary of remaining errors
- Repeated error condensing — full detail on first occurrence, compact on repeats
- Chronological error sorting by source position
- Zonny — the compiler mascot with personality-driven help messages

**Semantic** *(in progress)*
- Type checker for all native expressions
- Real mutability enforcement
- Type inference from first assignment
- Block expression validation with `give`
- Unreachable code detection after `give`
- Scope chain with `Symbol` entries

**Documentation** *(all created in this version)*
- `NERT`, `precedence_doc`, `forms_doc`, `condition_field_doc`
- `types_doc`, `expression_doc`, `statements_doc`, `variable_vs_value_doc`
- `declaration_stmt_doc`, `assignment_stmt_doc`, `give_stmt_doc`
- `break_stmt_doc`, `continue_stmt_doc`

> Interpreter rewrite pending — will complete this version.

## v0.1.3 — *The CLI Update 2.0*
> Complete environment overhaul with cross-platform distribution and language refinements

**CLI & Distribution**
- **Unified Entry Point** — The compiler is now globally accessible via the `zon` command.
- **Linux & Android Integration** — Implementation of `shebang` in `main.py` combined with symbolic links in `$PREFIX/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` and execution permissions.
- **Windows Portability** — Added `zon.bat` wrapper and environment variable manipulation to enable global PATH access in CMD/PowerShell.
- **Formal Documentation** — Created comprehensive installation guides in `install_guides/`:
    - `INSTALL_LINUX.md`
    - `INSTALL_WINDOWS.md`
    - `INSTALL_ANDROID.md` (optimized for Termux).
- **Command Suite Expansion** — New standardized command flags:
    - `r` / `run`: Execute source files.
    - `vers`: Display compiler version.
    - `help`: Command usage guide.
    - `setpath` / `showpath` / `clrpath`: Internal workspace path management.
    - `repl`: Interactive mode with `EOF` trigger for multi-line execution.
    - `setfile`: Streamlined file creation (including directory tree) with an optional immediate run prompt.
- **CLI Security Layer** — Added dedicated error handling and safety messages specifically for CLI operations, independent from the core language diagnostics.

**Language Refinements**
- **Numeric Underscore Support** — Added numeric separators for readability (e.g., `1_000_000`).
    - Implementation is strict: only permitted for thousands separation in integers or the integer part of a float.
    - Disallowed in decimal parts or as leading/trailing characters.
- **Initialization Shadowing** — Refined `Initialization Statement` logic.
    - Shadowing (e.g., `mut x = 10; inmut x = x`) is now valid.
    - The shadowed variable remains accessible during the initialization of the new variable before being replaced in the scope.
    - Strict validation remains: standard assignment to an uninitialized variable (shadowing or not) will still trigger a diagnostic.

**New Lexer Errors**
- `E0007` — Invalid underscore usage (e.g., `100_` or `1_0.0`).
- `E0008` — Forbidden underscore usage in the decimal part of a float (e.g., `3.12_14`).

**Technical Fixes**
- **F-String Compatibility** — Refactored internal rendering to support Python 3.11 by removing nested quotes and backslashes in template expressions.
- **IO Normalization** — Fixed newline stripping issues in Windows environments during file generation.

## v0.1.2 — *The Struct Update*
> Zonetic gets structs — data blueprints, objects, and field access

**Language**
- `struct` keyword and `struct form` added — defines a named blueprint of fields
- `object` — a clone of a struct, created with a construct expression and stored in a variable
- `field` — a named slot inside a struct or object, declared with the same syntax as variables
- `impl` form planned for a future revision — methods not included in this version
- Struct names follow PascalCase convention and share the namespace with functions
- Structs registered through pre-scan — reachable from anywhere in the program
- Structs can only be declared in global scope

**Construct Expression**
- Syntax: `StructName[]`
- Fields can be passed by index, by name, or mixed — same rules as function call parameters
- Fields with default values are optional in the construct
- Uninitialized fields cannot be read until assigned

**Field Expression**
- Syntax: `object.field`
- Supports unlimited nesting — `object.field.field.field`
- Returns the value and type of the accessed field

**Field Assignment Statement**
- Syntax: `object.field = expr` or `object.field.field op= expr`
- Supports standard and compound assignment operators
- Respects field mutability declared in the struct

**Nee Parser Errors**
- `E2027` — Expected and identifier after `struct`
- `E2028` — Invalid field access syntax
- `E2029` — A field is assigned in the construct expr, but that same field had already been assigned before in the same construct.
- `E2030` — Positional assignment was found after starting to assign by key in construct expr
- `E2031` — It was expected, to continue or to terminate the construct expr, something else was found
- `E2032` — A field expression was used in the statement area, meaning no one expects a returned value

**New Semantic Errors**
- `E3027` — duplicate parameter name in function declaration
- `E3028` — complex expressions are used in the declaration of fields
- `E3029` — An attempt is being made to assign an expr to a field that is not the type of the field.
- `E3030` — object does not exist in scope
- `E3031` — variable exists but is not a struct object
- `E3032` — A field is assigned in a construct by key, but the key does not match any existing field in the struct
- `E3033` — field assignment target does not exist
- `E3034` — attempt to assign to an inmut field that already has a value
- `E3036` — It involves using a field that does not exist in the struct
- `E3037` — too many values passed to construct
- `E3038` — struct does not exist
- `E3040` — field does not exist in struct
- `E3041` — function name conflicts with existing struct name
- `E3042` — struct name conflicts with existing function name
- `E3043` — empty block expression
- `E3044` — field name shadowing inside struct block
- `E3045` — assigning a field that does not exist (this in a struct declaration)
- `E3046` — invalid statement inside struct block

## v0.1.1 — *The Function Update*
> Zonetic gets functions — the most significant feature addition since v0.1.0

**Language**
- `func` keyword and `func form` added — functions are now a first-class construct
- `return` statement added — exits a function and produces its value
- `-> type` explicit return type required on every function — including `-> void` for no return
- `void` type added — exclusively for function return types
- Parameters require explicit mutability — `mut` or `inmut` always declared
- Parameters always passed by copy — changes inside never affect the original outside
- Default parameter values supported — optional at call site
- `func main` as optional program entry point — if present, execution starts there regardless of declaration order
- Pre-scan phase added — all functions registered before execution begins, enabling forward references
- Recursion supported — each call creates an independent `CallFrame` with its own scope
- Functions see the global scope — variables declared outside any function are visible inside all functions

**Call Expression**
- Positional parameters — values matched left to right
- Keyparams — parameters passed by name using `name=value`
- Mixed calls supported — positional first, keyparams after; once a keyparam is used all following must be keyparams
- Keyparam terminology adopted — `param` for positional, `keyparam` for named

**Terminology**
- `parameter` adopted as the single term for both declaration and call contexts
- `keyparam` introduced for parameters passed by name in a call expression
- `argument` retired from Zonetic terminology to avoid confusion

**New Parser Errors**
- `E2013` — missing function name after `func`
- `E2014` — missing `(` after function name
- `E2015` — missing `=` after keyparam name in call
- `E2016` — missing `mut` or `inmut` to start a parameter
- `E2017` — missing parameter name after mutability keyword
- `E2018` — `void` used in invalid context
- `E2019` — invalid type in parameter declaration
- `E2020` — missing `:` after parameter name
- `E2021` — missing `->` after parameter list
- `E2022` — invalid return type after `->`
- `E2023` — keyparam passed more than once in the same call
- `E2024` — positional parameter found after a keyparam
- `E2025` — missing `,` or `)` after parameter (replaces E2015 for unclosed parameter lists)
- `E2026` — `return` found outside any block expr

**New Lexer Errors**
- `E0008` — malformed identifier starting with a digit

**New Semantic Errors**
- `E3013` — Existing function name being used for a new function
- `E3014` — `return` found in some block expr but not in function context
- `E3015` — The return type of the expression that has a `return` found in a function does not match the return type of that function.
- `E3016` — A value(`inmut`) is initialized in a loop when the value is not in the scope of the loop but at least one above it.
- `E3017` — An attempt is being made to declare a function within a function.
- `E3018` — `give` is used in a block that is not valid for expressions, for example: `func`
- `E3019` — semantic detects that there is no `return` in all possible paths (this only applies to functions that do not `return` `void`)
- `E3020` — It's called a non-existent function
- `E3021` — Parameters are added to a function call that the function does not need (if it has zero declared parameters).
- `E3022` — Parameters are being passed that do not match the declared parameters of the function.
- `E3023` — A keyparam is passed with the name of a parameter not declared in the function.
- `E3024` — Passing a value twice to a function parameter causes a collision; only one value can be passed per parameter.
- `E3025` — It was necessary to pass parameters in the call that the function expects
- `E3026` — A function call that returns `void` is used as an expression

**New Semantic Warnings**
- `W3005` — unreachable code below `return`
- `W3006` — unreachable code below `continue` or `break`

**New Runtime Errors**
- `E4002` — Stack Overflow

**Zon Std Lib Mininum**
- `print` print string on screen
- `readInt` — takes a string as an argument and returns a int
- `readFloat` — takes a string as an argument and returns a float
- `readString` — takes a string as an argument and returns a string
